# Gait-analysis-using-Pose-Estimation-
The project utilizes YOLO pose estimation to extract key points from human body poses in each frame of a video. These key points represent specific body parts such as nose, eyes, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles, each identified with a unique ID. The extracted key points' x and y coordinates are then saved for further analysis.
